# Week06 - Linked List

## Definition:

**Linked List** is yet another data structure that we'll look at. It offers constant execution time for operations like adding and deleting of elements at the front of the sequence. Linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory like it is with arrays. Instead, each element is a data structure that has a reference to the next element.
